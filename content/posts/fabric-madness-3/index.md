In the previous post, we discussed how to use Spark for feature engineering. In this post, we will discuss how we can instead use Dataflow Gen2 for a low code approach to feature engineering.

## What is Dataflow Gen2?

Dataflow Gen2 is a service that allows you to create data pipelines without writing any code. It is a low code solution that allows you to create data pipelines using a visual interface. It is a great tool for data engineers who are not familiar with coding or for those who want to quickly create data pipelines without writing any code.

## How to use Dataflow Gen2 for feature engineering?

To use Dataflow Gen2 for feature engineering, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new data pipeline in Dataflow Gen2.
2. Add the data sources that you want to use for feature engineering.
3. Add the transformations that you want to apply to the data sources.
4. Run the data pipeline to generate the features.


## Conclusion
In this post, we discussed how to use Dataflow Gen2 for feature engineering. Dataflow Gen2 is a great tool for data engineers who are not familiar with coding or for those who want to quickly create data pipelines without writing any code. It is a low code solution that allows you to create data pipelines using a visual interface.
