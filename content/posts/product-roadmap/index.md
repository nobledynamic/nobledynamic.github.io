A product vision statement is a succinct, inspiring declaration of the overarching goals or purpose of a product. It outlines what the product aims to achieve, who it serves, and how it provides value. The product vision serves as the north star for the business and product team, guiding their decision-making and strategy. 

The product vision is key for several reasons: 

* Direction: It provides a clear direction for the product, ensuring that all efforts are aligned towards achieving the same overarching goal. 
* Inspiration: A compelling product vision can inspire and motivate the team, fostering a sense of purpose and commitment. 
* Decision-Making: It serves as a reference point for decision-making, helping to prioritise features, resolve conflicts, and align the product with the business strategy. 
* Communication: It communicates the purpose and value of the product to stakeholders, helping to manage expectations and build support. 

The product vision is closely related to the product roadmap. While the product vision outlines the long-term goal or purpose of the product, the product roadmap is a strategic document that outlines how the product will achieve this vision over time. It details the key features, improvements, and milestones that will contribute to the realisation of the product vision. 

In essence, the product vision provides the 'why' and the product roadmap provides the 'what' and 'when'. Both are critical components of effective product management and should be closely aligned to ensure that the product is moving in the right direction and delivering value to users and the business. 

Following on from the vision, the roadmap is used to articulate the steps for how the vision is realised, ensuring that all efforts are aligned towards achieving the same goals. This helps to prioritise all tasks and initiatives that contribute to these goals. 

Once defined and agreed, the roadmap can then be used to facilitate communication and alignment across different teams within the business. By providing a clear picture of what is being worked on and why, it helps to ensure that all teams - from sales and marketing to engineering and support - are all on the same page. 

It also helps with managing stakeholder expectations. By clearly outlining what is being worked on and when it is expected to be delivered, it helps to set realistic expectations for both internal stakeholders (like executives and team members) and external stakeholders (like customers and partners). 

Itâ€™s important to note that the roadmap is not a fixed document and should be regularly reviewed and updated.
